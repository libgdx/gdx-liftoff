# The logging level determines which messages get shown about how Gradle itself is working, such as if build.gradle
# files are fully future-proof (which they never are, because Gradle constantly deprecates working APIs).
# You can change 'quiet' below to 'lifecycle' to use Gradle's default behavior, which shows some confusing messages.
# You could instead change 'quiet' below to 'info' to see info that's important mainly while debugging build files.
# Note that if you want to use Gradle Build Scans, you should set the below logging level to 'lifecycle', otherwise
# the link to the scan won't get shown at all.
