gdxVersionTip=Version of the official LibGDX libraries. The latest release was {0}.
gwtVersion=GWT version:
gwtVersionTip=Version of GWT libraries. Should match version used to build the GWT backend. Defaults to 2.8.2. Other versions are NOT guaranteed to work out of the box due to API changes. Pre-1.9.5 LibGDX uses GWT 2.6.1, 1.9.5 to 1.9.8 used 2.8.0, 1.9.9 up use 2.8.2
gwtPlugin=GWT plugin version:
gwtPluginTip=Version of the Gradle plugin for GWT applications: de.richsource.gradle.plugins:gwt-gradle-plugin
sdkVersion=Target Android API:
sdkVersionTip=Version of the targeted Android API; should be at least 29.

robovmVersion=RoboVM version:
robovmVersionTip=Version of RoboVM framework used by the default iOS backend. 2.3.7 is recommended.

gradleWrapper=Add Gradle wrapper
gradleWrapperTip=If checked, generator will create executable "gradlew" and "gradlew.bat" files, which allow you to run Gradle application without globally installing it. If it's already installed globally, you can turn this off to limit the total size of project's files.
gradleTasksPrompt=Enter Gradle tasks to run after project generation.
gradleTasksTip=The generator can optionally run Gradle tasks after your project is ready. If you include the Gradle wrapper, it will be used to execute the tasks - otherwise it is assumed that Gradle is globally installed and available through "gradle" command. You don't need to enter "gradle" or "gradlew" manually, just list the tasks. Suggested tasks:\n- lwjgl3:run - runs the desktop application, allowing you to test the project template. Change "lwjgl3" to "desktop" if you use the older LWJGL2 platform.\n- lwjgl3:jar - Liftoff uses "jar" to build runnable JAR files that can be distributed; other setup tools often call it "dist" instead, but it does the same thing.
